    <description>
      A simple 2D physics package for SFML.  It only supports circular and AABB bounds.
      It makes no attempt to detect or handle inter-frame collision misses.  It is
      however perfectly suitable for most classic 2D games.

      It has a pointerless API that mimics the SFML API conventions.

      This version now supports use of vector of PhysicsSHapes with the follwoing caveats:
      (1) The vector must use reserved space and not grow beyond it in order to keep the data fromre locating
      (2) You must pass vector.data[N].getBody() to world.AddPhysicsBody() in order to set it to the actual body and not a copy
   
      
      Basic documentation is at https://github.com/profK/SFPhysics.
